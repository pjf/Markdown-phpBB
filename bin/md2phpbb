# ABSTRACT: Turn markdown into phpBB code
# PODNAME: md2phpbb
# VERSION

=head1 SYNPOSIS

    phpbb2md < somefile.md > somefile.phpbb

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Converts markdown into phpBB / BBcode format. Will read from
STDIN, or files on the command-line. All output is sent to
STDOUT.

Internally, this is a thin wrapper around the L<Markdown::phpBB> module.

=head2 USING WITH VIM / VIMPERATOR

Of most use is C<:%!md2phpbb> in vim, which will replace your current
buffer (written in markdown) with the phpBB equivalent code. You can even
bind it to a key (place in your `~/.vimrc` file):

    :nmap <F5> :%!md2phpbb<CR>

If you've installed md2phpbb into a user (rather than system) directory,
then running vim from vimperator may not have all your perl-specific
environment variables in place. In that case you may need to use full
paths:

    :nmap <F5> :%!perl -I/home/pjf/perl5/lib/perl5 /home/pjf/perl5/bin/md2phpbb<CR>

If you're using vimperator, phpBB will get in the way of using CTRL-I to
invoke vim. You can allow CTRL-E (or another key of your choice) to also
invoke the editor by adding the following to your `~/.vimperatorrc` file:

    :inoremap <C-e> <C-i>

You can now edit a message using vim/vimperator, and hit F5 to
convert it from markdown into phpBB. Because the converter doesn't
change existing phpBB code, you can make further edits in markdown
and hit F5 as many times you need to refresh into phpBB.
